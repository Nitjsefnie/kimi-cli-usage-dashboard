# Canonical Cross-Check — 2026-05-07

End-to-end correctness check: ccudash's per-session aggregates vs. the
canonical `parse_session.py --cache` walked over the same R2 mirror.

## Mirror

- Path: `/tmp/analyst.BCYKic3p/r2/`
- Refresh: `rclone copy r2:claude/ /tmp/analyst.BCYKic3p/r2/` (exit 0, no-op
  since mirror was already in sync)
- Total `*.jsonl`: **1169**
- Unique parent dirs: **536** (459 session folders at depth 6 + 69
  `data/subagents` dirs at depth 8 + a few outliers)
- Bucket size on disk: **1.4 GiB**

## ccudash ingest

Lifespan startup ingest, fresh `claude_viz` DB:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| trigger | startup |
| r2_listed | 451 (main `<stem>.jsonl` files only) |
| inserted | 451 |
| reparsed | 0 |
| deleted | 0 |
| error | null |
| duration | 143.1 s |

Cron ingest fired at :15 and saw no changes (`reparsed=0` against the
just-ingested rows).

## Postgres aggregate (sessions table SUMs)

| metric | value |

| cache_read_tokens | 20,139,112,548 |
| output_tokens | 33,863,800 |

## Canonical `parse_session.py --cache`

Walked the same `/tmp/analyst.BCYKic3p/r2/` tree. Wall: 20.1 s.

## Gap source — main-less folders

13 session folders contain ONLY peer `agent-*.jsonl` files with NO main
`<stem>.jsonl`. Example:

```
/tmp/analyst.BCYKic3p/r2/C--Users-zmatek-PycharmProjects-kvalita/03de022a-47b0-46ce-87fd-3bf81ebf46ad/
  agent-abc8ca8.jsonl
  agent-ae2dd54.jsonl
  agent-af45044.jsonl
```

`backend/ingest._list_main_jsonls` skips folders without a main file
(`stem != session_dir`), but `parse_session.py` walks all `*.jsonl`
recursively and dedups by inner-record uuid — so canonical includes the
agent transcripts as part of the global walk while ccudash drops them.

These appear to be sub-agent transcripts whose parent session folder was
deleted (the parent `<uuid>.jsonl` was cleaned up but the sub-agent
sidecars were not). They account for ~$40 / ~700 turns of the gap.

## Verdict

**FAIL** — first run.

The plan's PASS criterion was `|cost delta| ≤ $0.10` (rounding noise from
per-request vs. per-session rollup). Actual delta is $40.56 — 405× the
tolerance. Sub-1% relative is irrelevant; the absolute gap maps to real
records being dropped, not floating-point noise.

Identified cause: `backend/ingest._list_main_jsonls` only emits an entry
when filename-stem == parent-dir-name. 13 session folders contain ONLY
`agent-*.jsonl` peers with no main `<stem>.jsonl` (the parent main was
deleted but the sub-agent traces remain). Per-file whitelisting drops
them; the canonical's `os.walk` + cross-file uuid dedup picks them up.

Fix landed in a follow-up commit (see git log after this entry):
`_list_main_jsonls` now falls back to the alphabetically-first
`agent-*.jsonl` when no stem-match exists, using the folder name as the
synthetic session_id. The orphan-sub-agent transcripts get ingested as
their own session row, closing the gap.

See the second cross-check entry below for the post-fix verdict.
